Question No 1: Add Project Features

Our online course selection platform offers a range of programming-related courses designed to cater to different skill levels and interests. Here are the key features of our platform:

- **Diverse Programming Courses:**

  Our platform provides a comprehensive collection of programming-related courses, covering various languages, frameworks, and development tools. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, there's something for everyone.

- **Course Selection by Credit Hours:**

  Users have the flexibility to choose courses based on credit hours. Each course is assigned a specific credit value, allowing users to tailor their learning experience according to their availability and preferences.

- **Credit Hour Limit:**

  To ensure a balanced and manageable course load, users are limited to selecting courses with a combined total of 20 credit hours or less. This feature promotes effective time management and encourages users to focus on quality learning experiences.

Question 02:Discuss about managing the state in my assignment project.

In my project, I utilize the state hook to manage bookmarks. This action occurs when a button is clicked. I've chosen to declare this functionality in the App.jsx file because it serves as a common parent component for the child components. This arrangement allows all child components to access and interact with the shared state.

  const [bookmarks, setbookmarks] = useState([]);

  const [credithour, setcredithour] = useState(0);

  const [remaininghour, setremaininghour] = useState(20);
  

--State Variables Initialization:

setbookmarks, setcredithour, setremaininghour are functions that allow you to update the corresponding state variables.

You've initialized  empty arrays, credit as 0, remaining as 20, and price as 0.

--Fetching Data with useEffect:
You're using the useEffect hook for fetching data. This hook allows you to perform side effects in your function components. It likely fetches data needed for your application.

--Handling State Updates in handlebookmarks Function:
Inside the function handlebookmarks, which has a parameter named course, you're likely handling updates to the state. This function is likely called when a button related to course selection is clicked.

--Rendering Components with State:
You're passing state variables (bookmarks, credithour, remaininghour) as props to child components like <Courses></Courses> && <Bookmarks></Bookmarks> . These child components receive the state as props and can use it for rendering purposes.
